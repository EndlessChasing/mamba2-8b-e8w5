# Mamba-2 8B E8/W5 execution checklist

Status: all 8.237B parameters quantized and independently decoded; full test PPL +20.21%, normal MK 18/48 to 15/48. Tokenwise development validation complete. Experimental release packaging underway; quality-retention target not met.

## Scope

- Official pure NVIDIA Mamba-2 8B, Apache-2.0 source model; 56 layers, width4096, groups8, untied256000-token embedding/head.
- E8 projections using calibrated LDLQ, initial scale0.9, damping0.01, two coordinate sweeps; W5 group128 for each vocabulary matrix separately.
- Keep original architecture and recurrent-state dimensions. Quantization is lossy; subsequent entropy encoding must restore every quantized source byte exactly.
- Use public upstream runtime and tokenizer. Do not distribute private research code, calibration text or private checkpoints.
- File-size minimum is a goal. Any comparative claim must name audited same-base alternatives, date, complete storage scope and quality results.

## Source and repository

- [x] Create public EndlessChasing/mamba2-8b-e8w5 repository.
- [x] Pin official NVIDIA revision and LFS SHA256s.
- [x] Download and verify official checkpoint and native SentencePiece tokenizer on GPU host.
- [x] Record source/runtime/codec licenses and include redistribution notices.
- [x] Push reproducible source and progress documentation; keep weights outside Git.

## Correctness before compression

- [x] Load official checkpoint into public mamba_ssm runtime with exact key/shape coverage.
- [x] Verify grouped gated RMSNorm, 8 SSM groups and independent embedding/output weights.
- [x] Verify native tokenizer and baseline finite-logit/token-cache checks.
- [x] Freeze calibration/development/evaluation inputs and protocol before candidate evaluation.

## Compression

- [x] Collect train-only FP32 input covariances for all112 projections.
- [x] Generate and decode-check every E8 matrix; bind resumption to source/config/calibration/code hashes.
- [x] Stream W5 embedding and lm_head separately, including all scales and rounding rules.
- [x] Save all remaining model parameters and configuration; verify complete parameter coverage.
- [ ] Build actual entropy-coded container with all tables, offsets, padding and metadata counted.
- [ ] Restore complete package with SHA256 equality and independent chunk decoding checks.

## Evaluation and release

- [x] Compare original and reconstructed quantized models on the same PPL and multi-key recall protocol.
- [x] Keep development screens distinct from full evaluation and numerical roundtrip checks.
- [ ] Measure actual model bytes and evaluation memory; separate compressed file size from inference residency.
- [ ] Release model artifact, tokenizer/config, checksums, source revision and reproducible commands.
- [ ] Publish quality changes, limitations and a bounded comparison to available same-base releases.

Only code, small reports and metadata are retained on the Mac. Original weights, covariances and generated model binaries remain on the GPU host during experiments.
